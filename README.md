### Overview
This GitHub repository contains a Python script for web scraping data from https://www.medicines.org.uk, a website that provides comprehensive information about various medicines. 
The script allows users to gather data by browsing medicines alphabetically (A-Z) and browsing medicines by active ingredients.
The scraped data is then compiled into a unique list of drug names for further analysis and processing.
